# weather

## weather forecasting algorithm using Tensorflow
1) xlrd & xlwt are used for xls file read/write
2) input has converted to binary array for binary classification
 - floating bit has initialized
3) data has normalized & upscaled
4) 5 layer fully-connected model
5) validated with 30% of validation set
6) label prediction of labelless data

## visualization using MATLAB
1) read map image
2) change hsv value of pixel based on predicted data
3) save images
=======
# public
read - write - view - tot - all

data Graphization using MATLAB
1) read : get valid data from raw data
2) write : make new file for some desired usage
3) view : graphize each data and save
4) tot, all : graphize sum & total data

map Visualization using MATLAB
1) read '.shp' file and convert to array
2) visualize population flow
 - circle with radius of population
