# weather

## weather forecasting algorithm using Tensorflow
1) xlrd & xlwt are used for xls file read/write
2) input has converted to binary array for binary classification
 - floating bit has initialized
3) data has normalized & upscaled
4) 5 layer fully-connected model
5) validated with 30% of validation set
6) label prediction of labelless data

## visualization using MATLAB
1) read map image
2) change hsv value of pixel based on predicted data
3) save images
